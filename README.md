# MobWeb_ImprovedSocialMediaPresentation extension for Magento

Improve the presentation of your products on the most popular social media websites.

Modern customers like to share their favourite products with their social circles. Unfortunately, Magento doesn't leverage the presentation possibilites offered by most social media websites. This extension closes that gap by integrating the Open Graph
(Facebook, Pinterest, Google Plus) and Twitter Card protocols into your Magento store.

After installing this extension, your products will be displayed perfectly formatted on all major social media websites. So if your customers share your products with their social media circle, the products will be presented in a perfect light and viewers will be more inclined to click on the product link.

This extension provides a full integration with the following social media websites:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Pinterest
* Google+

Note: This extension does not add any sharing functionality directly to your store. It leverages your existing sharing functionality and makes sure that the products are displayed perfectly on the social media websites.

## Installation

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
